# Connect In People

**You will literally connect people between them, but can you do more ?**

A 5 minutes narrative game where you will connect people between them.

This game was made by Nutriz and Pinky for the Godot Wild Jam #21. Obviously it was made with the amazing open source Godot Engine (https://godotengine.org/)

## Story

You are Marie, a young woman of 20 who has just found a job in telecommunications. It's 22 February 1922, it's your first day as a switchboard operator. You will have to *connect* the parts between them. You are inexperienced but optimistic. Your team leader is waiting for you! Good luck...
